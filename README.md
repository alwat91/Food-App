Technologies Used:
	- Javascript
	- HTML
	- CSS
	- MongodDB
	- AngularJS
	- Express

Approach Taken:
	- We first planned the main project's theme then followed with creating the schemas that we will use for the project.
	- From there we talked about wireframing and how the site is going to look like. (This part changed a bit since we learned a lot of usage for angular that we didn't need as much views as we thought).
	- From there we built from the backend primarily to make sure that POSTMAN was able to call from it through using a seeds file while working on having the UI routes be able to at least display a page in terms of calling it in the front end.
	- After the backend was completed, we paired programmed to complete the front end part which involved the full CRUD part.
	- From there we went to heroku deployment.

Unsolved Problems:
	- Ingredients need Create, Add, and Delete.
	- Some of the CSS could still be retouched and be made in terms of making the site look better.
	- Dates could be displayed better (maybe use filter?)
	- Removing the Signup and Login buttons above to just sign out when a user is logged in.
	- Reroute forms to update without reloading. (need state.go)
	- Once those are complete API routes.

	Challenges:
	- The first challenge we encountered was how everyone in the group saw the project to be. The way we wanted to set it up was confusing at first since all three of us had an idea of how we wanted to do the project and what would be the different models that we could use in the app.
	- The second challenge was working separately and how we could code in the files without messing up each other's codes or having merge conflicts.
	- The third challenge was that it seems we didn't specify the roles enough so we had to rush towards the last two days to create the front end part. We finished it due to pair programming where everyone was in the same page and encountering problems were solved much quicker since we each had our own input on how to solve the problems.
	- The fourth challenge were internet issues. Some of us were lagging on a regular basis, and one of our group members did encounter a wifi issue so meeting via video calls not possible so most of the communication was done via slack. We did remedy it by using another computer which had a quicker bandwidth.


	Benefits:
	- problem solving was done quicker with group members due to strengths.
	- being weak at one thing allowed you to learn more through learning how another member coded but we divided it so each of our strengths were being used especially during the times when we were rushing.
	- having strong communication allowed us to quickly solve problems that we thought we would not have enough time for.
